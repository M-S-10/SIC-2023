Project Prototypes for Telangana School Innovation Challenge 

In collaboration with Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC), Govt. of Telangana, Inqui - Lab Foundation conducts an annual School Innovation Challenge. The objective of the School Innovation Challenge (SIC) is to inspire students to solve problems by using a simplified design thinking process as a method to innovate. Each participating team undergoes an online, hands-on animated course on problem-solving via mobile followed by a call for submission of ideas. 25 best ideas are selected for in-person prototyping of the solutions and boot camps.

Here are some of the projects that I have been assigned to mentor and conduct prototyping sessions.

1. Patient Medical Emergency Alert System.
2. Handwriting improving sensor pen
